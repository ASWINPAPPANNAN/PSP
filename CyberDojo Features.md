# CyberDojo - Desired Features List

- Support for .md file to add images and formulae in the instruction file.
- Fork option in the front page itself (create as exercise)
- Share link/ copy link option when forked (Now we need to copy sesion ID and create the exercise link manually)
- Share exercise via email option (and to track how many responded similar to Google forms)
- User needs to login (student name, rollno and email id) before entering the session,
 so that it will be easier to track students based on their names/ roll no/ email ID, instead of avatars
- Option to create course and modules
- Categorization of exercises (to assign them to course and modules)
- Dashboard to view the students progress in the course or modules
- Option to disable students from viewing others code for a specific period
- Auto save option (Now, we need to run once to save content)
