1. Write a program which, given the length of two sides of a right-angled triangle, returns
the length of the hypotenuse. (Hint: x ** 0.5 will return the square root.) (page 72)

2. Assume you have the assignment numbers = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
Write a function that computes the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list
numbers. (page 76)
 
3. Write a function day_name that converts an integer number 0 to 6 into the name of a
day. Assume day 0 is “Sunday”. Once again, return None if the arguments to the function
are not valid.

4. Write a function that removes all occurrences of a string from another string:
        1 remove_all("an", "banana") == "ba"
        2 remove_all("cyc", "bicycle") == "bile"
        3 remove_all("iss", "Mississippi") == "Mippi"
        4 remove_all("eggs", "bicycle") == "bicycle"
