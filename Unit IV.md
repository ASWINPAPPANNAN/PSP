# UNIT IV: COMPOUND DATA
## LISTS, TUPLES, DICTIONARIES

Lists, list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop, mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters; Tuples, tuple assignment, tuple as return value; Dictionaries: operations and methods; advanced list processing - list comprehension, Illustrative programs: selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.

### Objective:
To use Python data structures â€“- lists, tuples, dictionaries

### Outcome:
Represent compound data using Python  lists, tuples, dictionaries

# 4 COMPOUND DATA

Primitive data types are basic data types such as int, bool and float. Compound data is any data type which is constructed using primitive data types and other compound data types. Python offers different compound data types (sequences) such as lists, tuples and dictionaries.


```python
>>>grocery = ['bread', 'butter', 'milk']
>>>absentees = [3, 14, 24, 35, 37, 41]
>>>movie_review = ['enthiran', {'5-rating':344, '4-rating': 28, '3-rating':0}]
>>>my_friends = ['akil', 'kapil', 'dhoni']
>>>my_favorite_menu = ['idli','dhosa','pongal']

>>> mylist = [12, 48, 12, 72, 34, 21]
>>> mylist
[12, 48, 12, 72, 34, 21]
>>> mylist[2]
12
>>> mylist[-2]
34
>>> mylist[3]
72
```
